The notes are captured in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian is a community powered note application that stores notes locally on your machine in markdown format

The quick capture tool is built using [Raycast](https://raycast.com). Raycast is a powerful MacOS launcher (similar to [MacOS spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp1008/mac)). However, Raycast is also community driven like Obsidian. 

I am combined two power community driven tools to build an Open source product that allows you to capture notes with easy. 

*Obsidian smart capture was inspired by [Lazy](https://lazy.so)*

### Obsidian Smart Capture Settings
The popup will remember the vault and path you used to capture the last note and it will open with same settings every trigger

## Future
I originally built this for personal use but after positive response on Reddit, I open sourced and released it everyone to use

The goal is to add more context awareness to Obsidian Smart Capture and make the best quick capture tool for Obsidian.
